#### Webpage
A webpage is a document that is commonly written using HTML (hypertext markup language) that is viewed using a web browser such as Google Chrome, Safari, Mozilla Firefox, or Internet Explorer.

---

#### Markup Language
A markup language uses *tags* that annotate text to change behavior or describe content .  Two markup languages you'll encounter frequently are HTML, which is used to write web pages, and XML, which is often used to store program data or configuration settings.

---

#### Tags
HTML tags usually follow a standard sequence of opening tag, followed by the text to be tagged, followed by a closing tag.  

~~~ html
    <tag>text to be tagged</tag>
~~~

Use any text editor to complete the following:

1\. Create a new text file and write the following text inside the document  

~~~ html
    Hello World!
~~~


2\. Save the file as "helloworld.html"  
3\. Open the file using a web browser to view it

You should see a very simple webpage with the Hello World! text in it. 
{: .success}
 
4\. Add a bold tag to the text in your file with the following code:

~~~ html
    <b>Hello World!</b>
~~~

5\.  Refresh your web browser to see the changes in your helloworld.html webpage.

Your Hello World text should now be in a bold font.  
{: .success}

---

#### Attributes
Many tags can have one or more optional *attributes* that go inside the opening tag.

~~~ html
    <tag attribute="value1" attribute2="value2">text to be tagged</tag>
~~~

6\. Let's change the font face and size of your text with the following code:

~~~ html
    <font face="Arial" size="20">Hello World!</font>
~~~

Your Hello World text should now be in the Arial font and much bigger!  
{: .success}

Notice how your web browser did not write any of the new words (font, face, size) to the screen.  The browser is built to process HTML tags and render webpages accordingly.
{: .info}

---

#### Nested Tags
Markup languages are also capable of nesting tags to apply multiple behaviors to content.

~~~ html
    <tag1><tag2 attribute="value">text to be tagged</tag2></tag1>
~~~

7\.  Let's nest our two examples with the following code:

~~~ html
    <font face="Arial" size="20"><b>Hello</b> World!</font>
~~~

Your Hello World text should now be in the Arial font and much bigger, and just the word Hello should be in bold!  
{: .success}

8\.  Finally, let's try one extra special tag:

~~~ html
    <sparkle>Make this text shine!</sparkle>
~~~

Does your text sparkle?
{: .warning}

9\.  Let's try this variation that uses an attribute instead:

~~~ html
    <font sparkle="on">Make this text shine!</font>
~~~

How about now, does your text sparkle?
{: .warning}

---

#### Challenge Question  

~~~ html
How does your web browser know which keywords are legitimate tags and attributes?  
Why did <b> and <font> work, but <sparkle> did not?
~~~
{: title="Question" }

~~~ html
Founded in 1994, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the Web.  It was created to develop protocols and guidelines that ensure long-term growth for the Web.

Programmers that develop web browsers (for example, Google developers make Chrome and Apple developers make Safari) do their best to follow standards set by W3C, the World Wide Web Consortium.  This means recognizing a standard list of tags and attributes and rendering them in an expected fashion.

However, not every browser follows these standards perfectly.  Some browsers have been programmed to recognize extra tags or attributes, or they can interpret and render tags differently.  

Have you ever encountered a webpage that wasn't working, and someone recommended that you try using a different browser?
